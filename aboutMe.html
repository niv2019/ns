        <h6> I am currently in my third year at McGill. I really like the software courses I took so far, although I am not so big of a fan of my hardware classes...</h6>
        <h6> I am really unsure of what path I will take after my graduation, which is why I am trying to learn as much as possible. I am completing a "Web and App developement" course, as well as a "Game Developement" course on Harvard's edx plateform, in addition to participating in McGill's GameDev Club </h6>
        <h6>My hobbies include reading, playing the violin and baking!</h6>
